            Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to
             disciplinary action regardless of technical soccer background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.

                     requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend
                      to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations 
                      that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be required to play all their games away.</li><br>
